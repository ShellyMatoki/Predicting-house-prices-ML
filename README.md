# Predicting-house-prices-ML
ML PROJECT

We chose the seminar to focus on the subject of "Predicting house prices "
Housing, being a basic human need, represents one of the largest financial investments most people make. Therefore, the ability to accurately forecast housing prices is important and helps potential homeowners, investors, real estate professionals and policy makers gain insights that help make informed decisions.
By forecasting housing prices, we can better understand market trends, assess investment risks and contribute to more stable and affordable housing markets. Furthermore, this project offers a unique challenge due to the dynamic nature of the real estate markets, which is influenced by many factors.
Since we chose an article that deals with prediction, we can conclude that our task is to solve a regression problem.
